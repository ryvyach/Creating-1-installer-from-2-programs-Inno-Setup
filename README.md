Hello, this repository is needed for those who have problems combining two programs into one installation file.
To make this file we need the Inno Setup program.
*I could make another tutorial on how to create an installer from 1 executable file, but this is already on the Internet.
It may seem to you that it is difficult to understand the script, then you can use a tutorial from the Internet to create your own installation file and at the time of editing the script you can simply substitute the lines from [Files] into your script.
*License - any .txt file, if you are doing it for yourself, you can just type something there and that’s it.
*Before loading the icon into the script, make sure that it is a “Group”; the icon from the application can be saved using “Resource hacker-master”

In principle, that’s all I have, if you have any questions, ask me, I’ll answer if I know)
